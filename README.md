# DAO Proposal: Lawyer Up
[DAOHUB: The Legal Status of the DAO](https://forum.daohub.org/t/the-legal-status-of-the-dao/81)

Due to complex legal challenges associated with being a distributed multi-national entity that exists without any current physical assets, we require legal advice on how to operate in the real world in various countries where our contractors may be located.

This proposal should be expanded with further resources, expansion of the requirements as well as specific suggestions of law firms or auditors who can fulfill these requirements.
